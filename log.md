# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Working through the first part of the Next.js Starter Guide

**Thoughts**: I have been studying daily for a while, but thought it would be a good idea to have something to show myself the progress I have made. Started to get familiar with Next.js today. So far it seems very straight forward and easy to use.

**Today's Progress**: Finished first day of Advent of Code

**Thoughts**: I found this website a few weeks ago, but then forgot about it until yesterday. First two challenges went well, but I gotta catch up.
