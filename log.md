# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Working through the first part of the Next.js Starter Guide

**Thoughts**: I have been studying daily for a while, but thought it would be a good idea to have something to show myself the progress I have made. Started to get familiar with Next.js today. So far it seems very straight forward and easy to use.

### Day 1: December 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished first day of Advent of Code

**Thoughts**: I found this website a few weeks ago, but then forgot about it until yesterday. First two challenges went well, but I gotta catch up.

### Day 2: December 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished second day of Advent of Code

**Thoughts**: Started putting my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) on github. The second part of the 2nd day was a little more challenging, but overall still going well. I gotta start doing two a day to catch up until christmas.

### Day 3: December 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Read up on static site generators

**Thoughts**: Decided to turn my clients wordpress site into a static site for performance and simplicity reasons, so I spend today reading up on Gatsby.js and Next.js, quickly deciding on Gatsby and will start on redesigning the site in the next couple days.

### Day 4: December 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Reading more on Gatsby themes and creating the starter

**Thoughts**: Gatsby seems straight forward, but GraphQl will need some time to get used to.

### Day 5: December 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Gatsby section on styling using css modules and nested components & started on the GraphQL section

**Thoughts**: I haven't come across css modules so far and it seems like it will really come in handy. If you have coded with React nested components will be familiar. I haven't worked with GraphQL or SQL so far, so this will take some time to get used to, but I am looking forward to it, so I can eventually do some Wordpress coding as well.

### Day 6: December 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished Gatsby GraphQL & Plugins section and 

**Thoughts**: Starting to getting the hang of it. Will finish the Tutorial tomorrow and then start working on my own projects with it the next few days. Looking forward to that!
