# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Working through the first part of the Next.js Starter Guide

**Thoughts**: I have been studying daily for a while, but thought it would be a good idea to have something to show myself the progress I have made. Started to get familiar with Next.js today. So far it seems very straight forward and easy to use.

**Today's Progress**: Finished first day of Advent of Code

### Day 3: December 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Read up on static site generators

**Thoughts**: Decided to turn my clients wordpress site into a static site for performance and simplicity reasons, so I spend today reading up on Gatsby.js and Next.js, quickly deciding on Gatsby and will start on redesigning the site in the next couple days.

### Day 4: December 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Reading more on Gatsby themes and creating the starter

**Thoughts**: Gatsby seems straight forward, but GraphQl will need some time to get used to.

### Day 5: December 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Gatsby section on styling using css modules and nested components & started on the GraphQL section

**Thoughts**: I haven't come across css modules so far and it seems like it will really come in handy. If you have coded with React nested components will be familiar. I haven't worked with GraphQL or SQL so far, so this will take some time to get used to, but I am looking forward to it, so I can eventually do some Wordpress coding as well.

### Day 6: December 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished Gatsby GraphQL & Plugins section and 

**Thoughts**: Starting to getting the hang of it. Will finish the Tutorial tomorrow and then start working on my own projects with it the next few days. Looking forward to that!

### Day 7: December 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished Gatsby starter tutorial

**Thoughts**: Gatsby seems pretty versatile, but less than Next.js? I will have to try it more to see the advantages and disadvantages of both.

### Day 8: December 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Resetting computer

### Day 9: December 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Setting up the basics for gatsby project

**Thoughts**: A client of mine has currently his site on wordpress, but the perfomance is slow and he wants something simpler than wordpress. Since his website is fairly small, I am going to try and replicate the design in Gatsby with Netlify CMS, so the client can go in and change text/pictures easily. Today I got the basic setup going and started to replicate the index site. I am going off of the  It's still a long way from here. But looking forward to it.

### Day 11-12, December 19-20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created Blog

**Thoughts**: The last two days I spent uploading and connecting my blog with a first post. I haven't coded it myself, but made a few changes to the design. Just wanted to start posting stuff until I create my own completed blog. One thing I have noticed is that I would start coding for an hour, but then end up deleting the code that I worked on for an hour, just because I didn't like it in the end.. I will try and set a goal for what I want to achieve during that hour everyday from now on, maybe that will help.
